# IGS Puzzle Bot

A Discord bot for practicing Go (Baduk/Weiqi) puzzles from the Online Go Server (OGS). This bot helps server administrators manage and share Go puzzles with their community members, tracks user progress, and maintains a leaderboard.

# Adding It To A Server

If you would like to add the bot to your server, I (skwidder or dontdiehard on discord), am hosting it and you can use this link to add it https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1313256722659541052

or feel free to self host.

## Usage

### Admin Commands
- `/add_puzzle [id] [position]` - Add an OGS puzzle to the server queue
- `/announce_puzzle [channel] [role?]` - Announce the current puzzle in a specific channel
- `/next_puzzle` - Move to the next puzzle in the queue
- `/add_collection [Collection Name]` Adds a puzzle collection to the approved collection list. This list will be used to randomly get a puzzle if the puzzle queue is empty

# Scheduling Puzzles

The bot supports automatic puzzle advancement with optional announcements. Server administrators can set up schedules in several ways using the `/schedule_puzzle` command.

## Basic Usage

### Daily Scheduling
Schedule puzzles to advance every day at midnight:
```
/schedule_puzzle daily
  [channel:#puzzles]  Optional: Channel to announce new puzzles
  [role:@puzzlers]    Optional: Role to ping for announcements
```

### Weekly Scheduling
Schedule puzzles to advance every Sunday at midnight:
```
/schedule_puzzle weekly
  [channel:#puzzles]  Optional: Channel to announce new puzzles
  [role:@puzzlers]    Optional: Role to ping for announcements
```

### Custom Scheduling
Set a custom schedule using cron expression:
```
/schedule_puzzle custom
  cron:"0 0 * * *"   Required: Cron expression for scheduling
  [channel:#puzzles]  Optional: Channel to announce new puzzles
  [role:@puzzlers]    Optional: Role to ping for announcements
```

### Turn Off Scheduling
```
/schedule_puzzle off
```

## Cron Expression Guide

For custom scheduling, you'll need to provide a cron expression. Here's the format:
```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Common Examples:
- `0 0 * * *` - Every day at midnight
- `0 12 * * *` - Every day at noon
- `0 0 * * 0` - Every Sunday at midnight
- `0 8 * * 1-5` - Every weekday at 8 AM
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours

## Puzzle Queue Behavior

When a scheduled advancement occurs:
1. If there are puzzles in the queue, the bot will move to the next puzzle
2. If the queue is empty or has only one puzzle remaining, the bot will:
   - Check approved puzzle collections
   - Randomly select a new puzzle from these collections
   - Add it to the queue
   - Move to the new puzzle

## Announcements

Announcements are optional. You can:
- Schedule without announcements by not specifying a channel
- Schedule with announcements by specifying a channel
- Schedule with announcements and role pings by specifying both channel and role

The announcement will include:
- The new puzzle details
- Visual representation of the puzzle
- Role ping (if configured)

### User Commands
- `/play` - Start solving the current puzzle
- `/show_puzzle [id]` - Display information about a specific puzzle
- `/leaderboard` - View the server's puzzle solving leaderboard

### Puzzle Solving Commands (DM)
- `![coordinate]` - Make a move (e.g., `!Q4`)
- `!reset` - Reset the current puzzle
- `!undo` - Undo your last move
